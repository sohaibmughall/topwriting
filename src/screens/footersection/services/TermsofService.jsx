                        Top Writing offers multiple revision offers for its clients to attain 100% client satisfaction. We have an extensive revision and refund policy and request all our valued clients to peruse these terms carefully to know how many revisions can be availed and how many of them would be provided free. It is important to read this policy to know what scenarios can qualify for a refund. </p>
<br /> <br />
<h2>Criteria for Revision(s)</h2>
<p>1: First revision is free and applicable to all scenarios. However, it has to be a revision and not a complete overhaul of the task unless the assignment does not meet crucial instructions given at the time of the order. A change of heart does not qualify for the complete revision offer but can be availed for little changes.
<br /> 2: Second revision and onwards are offered free of cost in case the assignment is not up to the mark in any way despite the provision of clear and concrete instructions. It needs to be mentioned that the second and subsequent revisions might not be available for free if the instructions were vague or the required changes were not a part of the preliminary instructions.
<br /> 3: If the client has a change of heart, or for some reason, they require revision, it shall be provided against additional fee unless offered complementary by the company.
<br /> 4: No additional work that was not mentioned in the initial order shall be entertained during an ongoing revision.</p>



<br /> <br />
<h2>Time Period for Revisions</h2>
<p>The first revision can be availed within two weeks of the assignmentâ€™s submission or elapse of the initial deadline. The second and subsequent revisions should preferably be availed within a week, but the duration can be extended in special circumstances. Paid revisions can be requested any time after the submission.</p>
<br /> <br />
<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Top Writing provides refunds in certain circumstances to ensure fair dealing and long-term connection. Here are the conditions that render the refund applicable:
<br />
<br />
1: Timely order cancellation: You can cancel the order and get a refund within two days of the confirmation if it does not accompany a tight deadline. Case in point: A three-day deadline project cannot be cancelled after two days of its confirmation.
<br /> 2: You can claim refund if the work is subpar despite clear instructions and multiple revision requests. Please note that refund cannot be claimed if the client requires revisions other or different than those communicated in the instructions.
<br /> 3: Please not that no demand for refund will be entitled for a 100 percent money back unless the order is canceled on time or when guaranteed by the company.
<br /> 4: The company shall retain its service charges while giving the refund (unless it is the first order that accompanies 100 percent money back guarantee by the company).
<br /> 5: 100 percent refund is available if the assignment has over 50% plagiarism or bears an F despite the provision of clean instructions.
<br /> 6: Both refunds and revisions (2nd and subsequent) will be furnished on proof by the client.
<br /> 7: Refunds will not be entertained after 25 days of the task submission.
<br /> 8: The investigation process of refund request may take up to 15-20 days.
<br /> 9: The amount of refund shall either be decided at the time of order placement or by the company.
<br /> 10: No orders shall quality for a refund that have been cancelled 48 hours or less before the deadline.
<br /> 11: Dissertation orders or those with lengthy work will only qualify for a refund if they have over 10-day deadline.</p>
