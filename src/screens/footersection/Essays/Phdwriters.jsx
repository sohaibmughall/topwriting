                        PH.D. WRITERS FOR PH.D. CANDIDATES                        </h2>
                        <p>
                        Most online writing services do not offer research and writing assistance to graduate students for one reason – they cannot find Ph.D. scholars to provide that kind of help. These writing services want to charge cheap prices for writing, and they know Ph.D.’s will not work for what they are willing to pay. Other companies claim to offer help with doctorate dissertation or other graduate level papers and claim to have Ph.D.’s to provide that help. In fact, however, they do not.</p>
<br /> <br />
<h2>How to Know that a Service has Legitimate Ph.D. Paper Writers
</h2>
<p>As students look for help in Ph.D. writing, they should look for the following clues that indicate a legitimate service, as follows:

</p> <br /> 
<p>Services that offer legitimate thesis and dissertation writing will not claim that they can have that thesis or dissertation written in just a few days. These are capstone projects that involve deep research and then original research on the part of the student. That research must be conducted locally by the student, where data is gathered and then turned over to a Ph.D. writer to finish assignment analysis and workup. How does this happen in 2-3 days? The answer is it doesn’t.

</p> <br /> 
<p>A legitimate service will charge an appropriate amount for the help – an amount that includes good pay for the writer/consultant. Ph.D. research paper writers do not work for $15 a page. At Top Writings we charge that reasonable amount so that we can keep our wonderful Ph.D. writers.</p> <br /> <br />

<h2>When and How We Assign Ph.D. Writers to Client Orders</h2>
<p>It is our policy always to assign a writer that has a minimum of one degree level above the level of the student placing the order. A high school student, then, shall have a writer with a Bachelor’s degree; and an undergraduate student shall have a writer with a Master’s. Once a student is in graduate school, however, their writers must have Ph.D.’s.

We assign our Ph.D. writers to orders just as we do any of our other writers – based upon their specialty fields. If, for example, you need Ph.D. thesis writing services in psychology, then you shall receive a Ph.D. psychologist as your consultant/writer.</p>
<br /> <br />
<h2>Where We Find Our Ph.D. Writers</h2>
<p>Most of our Ph.D.’s are retired from academia or professions related to their degrees. Because they are first and foremost scholars, they like to keep current in their fields and love reading the newest research. Writing for Top Writers allows them to do this and to get paid while they do it – it’s a win-win situation for both of us. AS education and research evolve, moreover, we find that we are always looking for more Ph.D.’s. We find them by tapping into our current writers for recommendations of colleagues. So far, this has worked well, and we have an extraordinary team ready for any thesis or dissertation topic.</p>
