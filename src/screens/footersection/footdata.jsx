    heading:"CUSTOM ESSAY",
    paragraph:"AMAZING UK CUSTOM ESSAY WRITING SERVICE : We tend to like custom-made products, although most of us do not buy a lot of them. They are usually more expensive than the more standard, generic products. And those standard generic products are usually just as good and serve our purposes. A shirt off the rack, for example, can look good on us, even if it is not custom-made. When it comes to writing products, however, there can be no compromises. They must be custom-made. And if UK students want the very best custom essay writing in UK countries, then they want to use only Top Writings - a company that will only produce custom essay and other academic writing products for students. What “Custom” Means to Top Writings: Our Writers: Top Writings employs a huge staff of expert native English-speaking writers – writers who have been educated in UK institutions and who have specialty areas of writing based upon their degrees. There is no way that any writing service can supply UK custom essays without qualified writers whose academic backgrounds are consistent with the products they create. At Top Writings, every order is matched with a qualified writer, so that it will be custom-written.How We Handle Orders: Each order represents a unique need from a unique individual. This is why we ask for so much detail in the ordering process. Just as a custom-made shirt requires exact measurements, custom essay papers UK require exact specifications. Once we have those specifications, we are able to find the qualified writing expert to complete the order. And we follow those specifications, because the piece of writing will be fully customized to meet the client’s needs. And when a customer receives his/her order, if it has not met every specification, we will re-write it until it does. That’s what custom writing is all about. Communication Means Customization: One of the reasons why we are the most sought after and used UK custom essay writing service, is that we have set up and use many methods of communicating with our customers. We have a support department open 24 hours a day; customers can contact us in multiple ways; customers will openly talk with their writers through a messaging system. The more communication that occurs, the more customized can be the final product a client ultimately gets. Our Policies Guarantee Custom Essay Writing: We have very strict policies in place that guide all that we do as we produce custom writing. Our writers begin each piece from scratch only after it has been assigned to them. They are required to craft fully original writing based upon authentic and careful research. We check all writing pieces for originality before they go out our door to a client’s. This is how we guarantee no plagiarism, and we have never had an incident of this terrible practice. Meeting Deadlines: Part of customization means honoring client deadlines. We will do whatever it takes to deliver products on or before the deadline date and time given by the client, and we can even meet urgent custom essays 6 hours UK deadlines. Many other policies and practices of Top Writings are in place to serve and protect our clients. Their personal information is encrypted and never shared; they have the best pricing that we can give for custom essay products; they can order any type of academic writing assignment that would be given by any tutor or professor and expect to have it perfectly crafted.When students want the very best in custom writing, they come to Top Writings. You, too can have the very best – just contact us with your first order."

    heading:"PHD WRITERS",
    paragraph:"PH.D. WRITERS FOR PH.D. CANDIDATES: Most online writing services do not offer research and writing assistance to graduate students for one reason – they cannot find Ph.D. scholars to provide that kind of help. These writing services want to charge cheap prices for writing, and they know Ph.D.’s will not work for what they are willing to pay. Other companies claim to offer help with doctorate dissertation or other graduate level papers and claim to have Ph.D.’s to provide that help. In fact, however, they do not. How to Know that a Service has Legitimate Ph.D. Paper Writers. As students look for help in Ph.D. writing, they should look for the following clues that indicate a legitimate service, as follows: Services that offer legitimate thesis and dissertation writing will not claim that they can have that thesis or dissertation written in just a few days. These are capstone projects that involve deep research and then original research on the part of the student. That research must be conducted locally by the student, where data is gathered and then turned over to a Ph.D. writer to finish assignment analysis and workup. How does this happen in 2-3 days? The answer is it doesn’t. A legitimate service will charge an appropriate amount for the help – an amount that includes good pay for the writer/consultant. Ph.D. research paper writers do not work for $15 a page. At Top Writings we charge that reasonable amount so that we can keep our wonderful Ph.D. writers. When and How We Assign Ph.D. Writers to Client Orders. It is our policy always to assign a writer that has a minimum of one degree level above the level of the student placing the order. A high school student, then, shall have a writer with a Bachelor’s degree; and an undergraduate student shall have a writer with a Master’s. Once a student is in graduate school, however, their writers must have Ph.D.’s. We assign our Ph.D. writers to orders just as we do any of our other writers – based upon their specialty fields. If, for example, you need Ph.D. thesis writing services in psychology, then you shall receive a Ph.D. psychologist as your consultant/writer. Where We Find Our Ph.D. Writers, Most of our Ph.D.’s are retired from academia or professions related to their degrees. Because they are first and foremost scholars, they like to keep current in their fields and love reading the newest research. Writing for Top Writers allows them to do this and to get paid while they do it – it’s a win-win situation for both of us. AS education and research evolve, moreover, we find that we are always looking for more Ph.D.’s. We find them by tapping into our current writers for recommendations of colleagues. So far, this has worked well, and we have an extraordinary team ready for any thesis or dissertation topic."

Students have received plagiarized work, work that was written so poorly that it was unreadable, and, sadly, some students have paid money and never gotten anything in return. Perhaps worst off of all are the students who have their financial information stolen or get bombarded with spam emails after working with the wrong writing company. Be very aware of writing services that offer extremely cheap prices, that have poorly designed websites, and promise essays in only a couple of hours. These are red flags that indicate the company is run by an offshore company that does not hire English speaking writers, or it is a front that has been set up to take your money and potentially your identity.

    paragraph:"WHO CAN DO MY COURSEWORK FOR ME IN THE UK Coursework. The bane of many students’ existences. With the huge amount of research and time it takes to pull everything together, your coursework is arguably the most arduous academic paper you will write. And that’s before you consider it goes towards your final mark so getting it absolutely right is essential. And also not forgetting that you may find yourself with coursework for multiple subjects all due to be handed in at the same time. It’s easy to see why students look for someone to do my coursework online. Where Can I Find a Writer to Do My Coursework? You can find coursework writers online, and in some areas, you may find coursework tutors too. Coursework tutors are great if you’re struggling with certain areas and need a bit of guidance, but if you’re willing to spend money on getting your coursework right, it makes more sense financially to pay a coursework writer.  When you see this and say “yes, I will pay someone to do my coursework for me”, your first stop should be TopWritings.com. We are a UK based company and we only employ qualified, native English speaking writers. This means your writer will have completed their own coursework and they know what the marking scheme is looking for in terms of content and structure. It’s always best to choose a UK based firm if you’re studying there as each country has different criteria for the higher marks. So don’t just say “do my coursework”, say instead “do my coursework UK”. Why Do Students Struggle with Coursework?  Aside from the time needed to properly research the material for your coursework, the pressure of needing to get it right is a big factor in why students turn to UKWritings.com when they want to say to someone “do my coursework for me”. Because your coursework can account for over 50% of your final mark, getting it right is a huge factor in whether you pass your course or not. This pressure can make it difficult for even the most academically gifted student to complete their coursework without any help. Why Us? Where else would you find reliable coursework writers that are qualified from a recognized UK academic institution and are an expert in their subjects at such low prices?

    paragraph:"NEED TO BUY DISSERTATION WRITING? LOOK NO FURTHER. A lot of students look for dissertation help, and a lot of online writing services advertise that they can supply that help. Only a few, however, have the writing staff to actually provide that help, so you must be careful as you seek to buy custom dissertation online writing. Fortunately, Top Writings is one of the few writing companies that can provide the custom products and services you need as you produce this capstone project. Beware of the Scams:  There are plenty of writing services that take advantage of students who are a bit desperate to get writing help, and if they are looking at tight deadlines for their dissertation sections or chapters, they may be tempted to use the first service they can find. Here are the ploys that fraudulent writing companies use: They offer really cheap prices – prices that are just not reasonable. Such cheap prices mean they are using foreign writers who are accessing dissertations on the same topic as yours and trying to re-write them. This never works out well, and you will find yourself with a piece of writing you cannot submit. They will claim that they can actually conduct the research that you are supposed to conduct at the local level that your tutor expects you to conduct. You know that when you submitted your dissertation proposal (if you have submitted it), your research design includes research that you are actually going to conduct. This part of your dissertation work you have to do. Any writing service that claims you can buy UK dissertation writing that includes original research is lying to you. They will take research that others have done and try to re-write it and pass it off to you. The outcome is never good. The Top Writings Way – Dissertation Help You Can Count On A dissertation has a very specific format and a very specific sequence of production. We understand this and we have the writers who understand this. When you pay for dissertation writing from us, you will get a personal researcher/writer who will work exclusively with you through the entire process, giving you the advice, the research and the writing you need and order – no more, no less. The Research Question: If you have not yet decided on a research question, your assigned writer can help you formulate a solid question to put into your proposal. The Proposal: you have to submit a proposal that explains your research question, justifies its important and then explains the original research you intend to conduct to answer that research question. If you have never written a proposal before, this is an area in which you can use the expertise of your assigned writer. The Literature Review: If you are short on time and do not enjoy writing research papers, you can turn this section or chapter over to your writer. S/he, being an expert in the field, will be familiar with the latest research that is related to your question and can produce and academically sound literature review section for you. The Design/Methodology: While your Top Writings expert cannot conduct the actual research for you, s/he can design your methodology and the instruments you will use for either a qualitative or quantitative study. This will allow you to collect the salient data that relates to your question. You will need to submit this design to your tutor or committee for approval, and it will be solid. The Results: Once you have finished your data gathering, you can send it over to your writer who will then write the chapter that presents that data in both graphic and prose formats. The Analysis and Discussion Sections: Depending upon your department requirements, you will have a section or chapter that analyzes the results you got and performs statistical calculations to determine the significance of your findings. This is a tough section, but your field expert can do it for you. When you buy dissertation services from Top Writings, you are always in control of the amount of help you need."
